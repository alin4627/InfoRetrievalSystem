Only wish there was a way to keep game play smooth when data is moving in and out in the background or a setting to suppress all other activity and give all resources this app when playing. Wish you had your own server to save purchases and game progress that worked across platforms.
380,4 in a row,Board,0,4.3,47698,This game is too easy! For difficulty settings after hard you should add extreme for people who want a challenge
381,Four In A Line Free,Board,0,4.3,133195,The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game  which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool

390,B-52 Spirits of Glory Deluxe,Arcade,$0.99 ,4.3,12,This used to be a go to app of mine. Great for casual play and doesn't need a data connection. Their recent update ruined it. I think something with the video ads causes the app to be poorly responsive.
391,Hungry Shark Evolution,Arcade,0,4.5,6071542,So addicting! Love this game.I have passed so many levels and this is my favorite game ever. Just one problem: The controls. Sometimes they're too sensitive and sometimes they're not sensitive enough.
392,Perfect Piano,Music,0,4.2,828489,Great game concept  with good graphics and some nice customization features. The gameplay against the AI is boring. The online play fun  if it works. The lag is killing the gameplay.

395,Critical Ops,Action,0,4.4,1397944,This premium game does not have purchases that allow advancement  and the frequent content updates add great aspects of adventure to the game. Though online play may prove difficult  the game possesses features and complexity absent in all other games.
