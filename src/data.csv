390,B-52 Spirits of Glory Deluxe,Arcade,$0.99 ,4.3,12,This used to be a go to app of mine. Great for casual play and doesn't need a data connection. Their recent update ruined it. I think something with the video ads causes the app to be poorly responsive.
391,Hungry Shark Evolution,Arcade,0,4.5,6071542,So addicting! Love this game.I have passed so many levels and this is my favorite game ever. Just one problem: The controls. Sometimes they're too sensitive and sometimes they're not sensitive enough.
392,Perfect Piano,Music,0,4.2,828489,Great game concept  with good graphics and some nice customization features. The gameplay against the AI is boring. The online play fun  if it works. The lag is killing the gameplay.
393,B-Grade Renegade,Action,$1.99 ,3.9,24,if you rate this app with one star even with two stars that means you are crazy. SORRY!! and the game work at a pizza place so nice and pretty i used play for years. and now i still use them more than my own apps. but the thing i am thinking about it the money. most things that we have to buy for things and the game why we have to buy money for it  it is just an game.

397,Hitman Sniper,Action,$0.99 ,4.6,408292,Great game concept  with good graphics and some nice customization features. The gameplay against the AI is boring. The online play fun  if it works. The lag is killing the gameplay.
398,FRONTLINE COMMANDO: D-DAY,Action,0,4.5,1736105,This game is really good! The only problem is that the background can look really dull after a while.
399,Fruit Ninja,Arcade,0,4.3,5091448,Fairly addictive game. However there are soooooo many ads displayed. I understand that the developers need a source of income but it is getting out of control.
400,Crossy Road,Action,0,4.5,4229977," Simple graphics, perfect for a crappy mobile device like mine! Thanks!"
401,Temple Run 2,Action,0,4.3,8116142,This premium game does not have purchases that allow advancement  and the frequent content updates add great aspects of adventure to the game. Though online play may prove difficult  the game possesses features and complexity absent in all other games.
402,Beach Buggy Blitz,,0,4.2,640974,Classic  I love the concept behind the app. Hopefully new updates will soon change the whole game to a new experience.
