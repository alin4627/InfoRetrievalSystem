389,Zombie Tsunami,Action,0,4.5,31311,Never have I seen a mobile game with so many adds for its own micro transactions. It's not even worth spending a penny on it. Compared to other games with micro transactions you barely get anything.
390,METAL SLUG 3,Arcade,2.99,3.5,2798,This used to be a go to app of mine. Great for casual play and doesn't need a data connection. Their recent update ruined it. I think something with the video ads causes the app to be poorly responsive.
391,Dungeon Village,Arcade,4.99,4.5,1000,So addicting! Love this game.I have passed so many levels and this is my favorite game ever. Just one problem: The controls. Sometimes they're too sensitive and sometimes they're not sensitive enough.
392,Trigger Fist,Music,0,4.5,69624,Great game concept  with good graphics and some nice customization features. The gameplay against the AI is boring. The online play fun  if it works. The lag is killing the gameplay.
393,Tone Sphere,Action,1.99,4.5,360,if you rate this app with one star even with two stars that means you are crazy. SORRY!! and the game work at a pizza place so nice and pretty i used play for years. and now i still use them more than my own apps. but the thing i am thinking about it the money. most things that we have to buy for things and the game why we have to buy money for it  it is just an game.
394,Dragon Island Blue,Racing,0.99,5,9119,The game ran smoothly on my device and kept me occupied for hours! Very Addicting!
395,Organ Trail: Director's Cut,Action,2.99,4.5,3389,It is a good finger exercise I'm obsessed ceped me up all night my friend is obseses cool man cool.oh and by the way love the music. COOL
396,DEAD TRIGGER,Racing,0,4.5,78918,"fps dropped so low after almost everytime you updated it. the latest update works flawlessly but now, you ruined it. i noticed it everytime you announce an update. please dont change any graphic setting every update,"
397,MY LITTLE PONY: Magic Princess Quests,Action,0,4.5,65201,Great game concept  with good graphics and some nice customization features. The gameplay against the AI is boring. The online play fun  if it works. The lag is killing the gameplay.
398,Fragment's Note,Action,3.99,5,1,This game is really good! The only problem is that the background can look really dull after a while.
399,Bad Piggies,Arcade,0,4.5,26259,Fairly addictive game. However there are soooooo many ads displayed. I understand that the developers need a source of income but it is getting out of control.
400,Odysseus: Long Way Home HD (Full),Action,4.99,4,39," Simple graphics, perfect for a crappy mobile device like mine! Thanks!"
401,Snail Bob,Action,0.99,4.5,9453,This premium game does not have purchases that allow advancement  and the frequent content updates add great aspects of adventure to the game. Though online play may prove difficult  the game possesses features and complexity absent in all other games.
402,Topia World Builder,,1.99,3.5,1775,Classic  I love the concept behind the app. Hopefully new updates will soon change the whole game to a new experience.
